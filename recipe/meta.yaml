  summary: A modern Python testing framework

  description: |
    Ward is a Python testing framework with a focus on productivity and
    readability. It gives you the tools you need to write well-documented and
    scalable tests. With Ward, you can describe your tests using strings instead
    of function names, and also use plain assert statements, with no need to
    remember assert* method names. Ward provides beautiful output that focuses
    on readability. It also manages test dependencies using a simple but
    powerful fixture system, while parameterising testing, which allows you to
    run a single test on multiple inputs. Ward has support for testing async
    code, and is supported on MacOS, Linux, and Windows. Ward is configurable
    with pyproject.toml, but works out-of-the-box with sensible defaults. It is
    also extendable via a plugin system (coming soon). Above all, Ward is speedy
    – Ward’s suite of ~300 tests completes in ~0.4 seconds on my machine.
